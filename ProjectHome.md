### For Programmers Only: ###

**Wormhole2** is dependent on Steinberg's **VSTSDK**, which is not open-source. In order to build the binaries you'll need the **VSTSDK** **2.4** as well as some additional files. These files contain parts of the **VSTSDK** and are available solely from **plasq** as they cannot be open-sourced.

[Sign the agreement](http://ygrabit.steinberg.de/~ygrabit/public_html/index.html) to get access to Steinberg's **VSTSDK**. Once 'signed', please let us know and we'll send you the files. Contact us here: [plasq.com/contact](http://plasq.com/contact)



### Wormhole2 was a [plasq](http://plasq.com) project - Opensourced October 2007 ###
